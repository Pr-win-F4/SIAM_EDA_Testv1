This repository contains a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the student_info.csv dataset, conducted as part of the AI/ML practice initiative by the SIAM chapter at my college. The analysis involves inspecting data distributions, visualizing relationships between variables, and identifying initial insights that can inform further modeling or preprocessing. The project serves as a foundational exercise to strengthen data handling and visualization skills using tools like Pandas and Matplotlib.
